# GVG 110 Video Mixer Panel modification/to Arduino + Network conversion

This script, together with a few hardware modifications and extra hardware, lets you use you **old GVG 110 Panel** for use with another hardware video mixer like the **ATEM** or with software mixers like **Vmix** or even **obs-studio**

It requires a websocket server, that manages the panel and sends the appropriate commands to the mixing software/hardware

## How did you manage to do this?
The simple answer: A few weeks of reverse engineering and studying datasheets
